# BlogApp

Welcome to my blog app! This app was created through Colt Steele's web development bootcamp.

The backend technologies used to create this application includes Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js. Also, Semantic-UI was used as the CSS Framework. 

Furthermore, the application has been deployed on Heroku. Find it [here](https://vast-brook-74618.herokuapp.com/)!
